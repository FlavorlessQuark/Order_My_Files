# Order_My_Files
Because git's ordering isn't always right

# But why

Turns out my leetcode exercises don't show in order...


## Future

- [ ] Add option to order files in subdir
- [ ] Add option to include dirs in the ordering
- [ ] Add option to order based on other criterias - Date, time of modification, reversed alpha, reversed num etc-
